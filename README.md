[**Open Solar Power in Streamlit**](https://solarpower-yu5kgl8v6gp4rdwcfolhq5.streamlit.app/)

This project is a Solar Power Insights Dashboard developed using Streamlit. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations and insights into solar power generation data about 2 Plants and compares the powers.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Users can explore different aspects of solar power generation through various charts and graphs of both plants.
- **Data Filtering:** The dashboard allows filtering data by Plant name, date range, different insights, and other relevant parameters.
- **Insights and Analysis:** The dashboard provides key insights into the performance of solar power plants, including trends and patterns in power generation.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is sourced from the [Solar Power Generation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data) available on Kaggle. The dataset contains power generation data from 2 solar power plants. It includes the following fields:

- **PLANT_ID:** Unique ID for each solar power plant.
- **PLANT_NAME:** Name of the solar power plant.
- **DATE_TIME:** Timestamp of the power generation data.
- **DC_POWER:** Direct Current (DC) power generated by the solar panels (in kW).
- **AC_POWER:** Alternating Current (AC) power generated by the solar panels (in kW).
- **DAILY_YIELD:** Daily energy yield (in kWh) for each plant.
- **TOTAL_YIELD:** Cumulative energy yield (in kWh) for each plant.

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of solar power generation across different Plants and periods, enabling detailed analysis of the performance and efficiency of solar power plants and giving us a comparison between them.

## Installation

To run this dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theDhanendra/solar_power.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd streamlit_app/solar_app.py
   ```
   
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash

## Create Virtual Environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Once the app is running, you can access the dashboard via your web browser. The dashboard provides an interface to explore the solar power generation data interactively. You can filter the data based on specific criteria and visualize trends over time.
