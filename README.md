[**Open Solar Power in Streamlit**](https://solarpower-yu5kgl8v6gp4rdwcfolhq5.streamlit.app/)

This project is a Solar Power Insights Dashboard developed using Streamlit. The dashboard provides interactive visualizations and insights into solar power generation data about 2 Plants and compares the powers.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Users can explore different aspects of solar power generation through various charts and graphs of both plants.
- **Data Filtering:** The dashboard allows filtering data by Plant name, date range, different insights, and other relevant parameters.
- **Insights and Analysis:** The dashboard provides key insights into the performance of solar power plants, including trends and patterns in power generation.

## Dataset

The data used in this project is sourced from the [Solar Power Generation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anikannal/solar-power-generation-data) available on Kaggle. The dataset contains power generation data from 2 solar power plants. It includes the following fields:

- **PLANT_ID:** Unique ID for each solar power plant.
- **PLANT_NAME:** Name of the solar power plant.
- **DATE_TIME:** Timestamp of the power generation data.
- **DC_POWER:** Direct Current (DC) power generated by the solar panels (in kW).
- **AC_POWER:** Alternating Current (AC) power generated by the solar panels (in kW).
- **DAILY_YIELD:** Daily energy yield (in kWh) for each plant.
- **TOTAL_YIELD:** Cumulative energy yield (in kWh) for each plant.

The dataset provides a comprehensive view of solar power generation across different Plants and periods, enabling detailed analysis of the performance and efficiency of solar power plants and giving us a comparison between them.

## Installation

To run this dashboard locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theDhanendra/solar_power.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd streamlit_app/solar_app.py
   ```
   
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
